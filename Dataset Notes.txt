Hello Becky and Christine,

Hope you both are doing well! I have created the dataset connecting the dual class list and Compustat.

Attached is a zip file containing the following:
dualclass_ein_merge.do: The code that merges Compustat and  the DualClass dataset
compustat_full:  Compustat Fundamental Annual (1990-2005 year)
compustat_ein: An intermediary "cleaned" dataset created to merge with dual-class
DualClass.xls: A version of the dual-class data with GVKEY from the author
gvkey_ein_dualclass.dta: The final merged dataset
gvkey_ein_dualclass.csv: The final merged dataset in Excel format
GVKeys.txt: List of GVKeys that did not merge
missing orgs.csv: GVKeys and EINs gotten from Compustat using GVKeys.txt
I describe my thought process in the code please let me know if there are any questions. 
One thing to note about the final dataset is that if there are missing EINs (EIN == ".") it is due to Compustat not having an EIN for that company. 
This is the case for 41 observations (out of  ~3,700 ).

Also ignore the "Secure:" in the subject line. Stanford keeps blocking this email for "containing sensitive info".

Best,
Mauricio
